# Python-Projects--APC

Those programs will work with coordinates of the object in an image, they can used for testing if it is a human or robot who is responding for example, they received the name of the image and the object in the image and its coordinates:forest, black -bison, 1.7,0.7.55. with the objects gave of the user, they can canculate and show the most central object, the larger, the smaller, etc. i used the basic structures of python: List, Dictionary, and other more

the second project show how many images have the x object, like: 3 images have a tree in object gave, 8 images have cloud in the object, etc. it show too width, weight,area, detour in the x/y, and show the less distant object from all the others (using the center)
